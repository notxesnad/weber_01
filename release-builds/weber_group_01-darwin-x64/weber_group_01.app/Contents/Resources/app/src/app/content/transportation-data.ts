    title: 'How did people arrive in Owensboro and how did they travel?',
    detail: 'Native American tribes traveled the Ohio River, developed trails, and followed buffalo traces. <br> Some of these <strong>trails</strong> became roads in Owensboro: Frederica Street was a buffalo trace from Owensboro to a salt lick near Panther Creek. As European and Euro-American settlers moved into Yellow Banks, trails became roads and a small port grew on the riverside. Commodities were transported on flatboats and later steamboats for sale and trade in Owensboro; many enslaved Africans were brought to Owensboro via the Ohio River.',

    detail: 'James Jones and his wife, Suzanna, moved from North Carolina to Kentucky via land and water routes. James was born on July 4th, 1760 in York County, Pennsylvania. His parents moved their family to North Carolina when he was a child. In 1778, when he was 18, James enlisted as one of the Minutemen who fought the British in the Revolutionary War. After serving, James married Suzanna and they had 17 children. Some of their children moved to Kentucky, and in 1824, at the age of 64, James and Suzanna followed. They first travelled over land, passing through the Cumberland Gap and arrived in Louisville that winter, where Suzanna died. James continued down the Ohio River by flatboat and reached Owensboro in spring. He settled in eastern Daviess County, where his son Andrew helped him build a cabin. In 1833 James received good news; veterans were eligible to draw a pension for their service, and James would receive $49.16 a year for the rest of his life.',

    title: 'Types of boats - Mid 1800’s – 1900',
    detail: 'The unique formation of the Ohio River called for specialized boats. Boat captains navigated flatboats through the variable waters; these flat-bottomed boats could pass over sandbars and through rapids and snags without getting stuck. However, they only traveled with the current. To go upriver you poled a keelboat or barge. Nicholas and Lydia Latrobe Roosevelt designed and built a flatboat to float from Pittsburg to New Orleans via the Ohio and Mississippi. Despite everyone’s doubts, the party had a successful journey, arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1809. Three years later the pair made the journey again, this time in a steamboat. As the party reached Yellow Banks, the New Madrid earthquakes hit, causing an unplanned stay in the town. Steam boats and paddle boats were used to transport people and goods long distances, and had the advanced ability to travel upriver. Agriculture and industry production increased to meet this newly available market.',

    title: 'Navigating the river - 1801-1824',
    detail: 'Zadok Cramer witnessed waves of immigrants coming through Pittsburgh with plans to travel west and south. Having recently opened a bookstore and bookbindery, Cramer took the opportunity to develop a guide for river travel. The first edition of The Ohio and Mississippi Navigator likely debuted in 1801, though no copies have been found. Subsequent editions expanded to include the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers. The third edition, published in 1802, lists Yellow Banks as “a settlement on the Kentucky shore.” In the fifth edition, published in 1806, French Island and Hurricane Island appear. Following the New Madrid earthquakes, Cramer published the eighth edition in 1814, which showed the impact the earthquakes and shocks had on the rivers. Owensboro saw little if any change; the entries for Yellow Banks and the surrounding islands match those before the earthquake.',

    detail: 'Steam boats kept pace with railroads, offering travelers transportation up and down the Ohio. For $3, you could travel in style to Louisville on a packet boat, or travel “on the deck” for free. Towboats pushed barges filled with bulk goods like grain and coal. They employed river and boat men but did not offer passenger transport.',

    title: 'Land transportation evolves with roads - 1867',
    detail: 'Owensboro sat at a crossroads of river and rail. On February 27, 1867, the Kentucky General Assembly passed an act chartering the Owensboro and Russellville Railroad Company. This allowed O & R to buy land in any county, and that county could purchase stock in O & R. Construction started May 3, 1869, beginning at Second Street and extending south to Lewis Street. The next summer Owensboro’s first locomotive arrived at the wharf. Construction sped along; the line connected to Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad in the summer of 1872. This freed Owensboro from the monopoly held by steamboats, and the inconvenience of a frozen river.',

    detail: 'Unfortunately, by 1873 O & R was running out of money. A group of investors bought the majority of stock and gained control of the line. The company became Evansville, Owensboro & Nashville Railroad. E O & N was big on dreams, planning to extend tracks to Nashville, but they were short on funding. In 1875 they went bankrupt, and Owensboro and Nashville Railroad Company took over the assets.  O & N stock was bought up by Edwin W. “King” Cole, who owned the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad. He intended to extent the lines to St. Louis and Chicago, but the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company swooped in and bested Edwin at his own game, buying up the majority of the stocks. By the 1890’s eight passenger trains a day came through Owensboro traveling to Louisville, Evansville, Nashville, and Memphis.',

    detail: 'The term ‘Buggy’ originated in England in the 18th century to describe a 2-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle which typically carried one passenger. By the mid 19th century In the United States, the term came to define a 4-wheeledcarriage for two passengers. Without a top, a buggy was called a ‘runabout’ or ‘driving wagon’ and if it had a standing top it was called a ‘Jenny Lind’. Carriages and buggies were typically lightweight personal transports used for moving people and light goods. Carriages and buggies were pulled almost exclusively by horses.Wagons were horse-drawn 4-wheeled vehicle primarily used to transport goods. They were heavier, generally simpler in design, and made for slower speed. They were pulled by horses, mules, or oxen.',
